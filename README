leapstergs-buildroot is a modification of stock buildroot that adds configs for the Leapfrog LeapsterGS device, as well as
retroarch, cores, and a menuing system.

This project is currently in its beginning stages, but if you want to give it a try, you can do the following:

1) Clone the source tree with git clone
2) Run 'make leapstergs_defconfig'
3) Run 'make'
4) You should have 2 output files in output/images. Use these files with sshflash to write to the device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
